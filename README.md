# esp32_automatic_gardening
this code is derrived from https://github.com/TheBrunez/ESP32_FlowerCare so credits also go to him :)


this code is only tested with 2 devices, but should work with more or less when changed in the config.h

for better understanding of how to use the code, also reffer to theBrunez readme.
for even better understanding try to understand the code itself, it was never ment to be published but ppl asked ;)
